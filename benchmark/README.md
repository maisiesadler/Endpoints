# Benchmark

Example.Api and Example.Controllers.Api are equivalent projects that use Endpoints and Controllers respectively.

There is a script, `./runbenchmarks.sh`, that will start and run both projects, then run a benchmark on the create user endpoint.

Latest results can be found [here](/benchmark/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/Benchmark.EndpointApiVsControllerApi-report-github).
